## [1.0.0] — OnDevice Core build 10 — 2026-09-05

Separate iOS 27 Core edition release: silver eye identity and shorter matching splash,
asynchronous document context with inspectable source snapshots, streaming and voice
presentation improvements, and safer document import cancellation. Native packaging
preserves app and share-extension entitlements and bundles dependency notices.
